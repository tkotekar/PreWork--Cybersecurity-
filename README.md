# PreWork--Cybersecurity-

Cybersecurity Pre-Work 
Hours to complete = 3 hours

Challenge 1 = complete 
Challenge 2 = complete 
Challenge 3 = complete

Notes:

I faced some issues working with the proxy for challenge 4 and 5 and therefor could not get the result key. I do know how to solve both challenges: 
  -Challenge 4 = Turn on both HTTP and HTTPS proxy and turn on the intercept in Burp. Refresh the profile on Security Sheperd and user on Burp will be "Guest", change it to "Admin". This will provide the result key for the challenge. 
  -Challenge 5 = Turn on intercept in Burp -> go through every user to find the user ID -> in burp send to intruder ->Go to the positions tab and change the user ID to the one in Burp initilaly -> go to payloads and add approx 20 different payloads-> go to target and start attck->go to results and click the response tab-> find the hidden users message (which will provide the result key).
